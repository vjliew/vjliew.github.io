            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I am currently a third year ECE student at the University of Texas at Austin. 
                During my time here, I worked on an <span class="textHover">embedded systems video game</span>. 
                A video explaining the game can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECaTCMqVMtI" rel="external" id="linky">here</a>.
                <span class="hiddenImage"><img src="./gameImage.jpg"></span>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some of my hobbies include swimming and spending time with my <span><span class="textHover">girlfriend&lt3</span>
                <span class="hiddenImage"><img src="./20220902_160322.jpg" width="350px"></span></span>. I learned how to swim when I was only three years old. 
                From then to my senior year of high school, I swam competitively and was even able to make State. I don't swim competitively anymore, 
                but I will occasionally swim laps.
                I also learned how to crochet recently (not to be confused with knitting) and made a <span><span class="textHover">stuffed horse</span>
